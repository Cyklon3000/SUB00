This game was originally made for the Brackeys Game Jam 2024.1 featuring the underlying Theme "What's behind the door".
Unfortunately the game had troubles being build at the end, which lead to me missing the deadline.

## Gameplay
SUB00 is a short and simple roguelike (I suppose), that is set in a underwater lab. Due to unknown reasons some test subjects escaped and are now hostile towards the last you play as survivor. 

### Controls
The game does not support anything but keyboard and mouse controls.
Move around using W, A, S and D or alternatively with the respective arrow keys.
Press space or hold left click in order to fire your weapon. Aim by pointing at enemies with your cursor
Use E to interact with doors and hatchways
Navigating menus is done via mouse.

### Goal
Flee through the three procedurally generated levels of the station. Fight enemies on the way out and avoid getting hit.
Killing enemies will grant you additional keys and scrap metal.
Former are used to open doors. Use keys wisely. Wasting them might lock you out of bonus rooms.
The Latter can be used to upgrade your weapon when proceeding to the next stage at the levels hatchway. Though you might wanna stick around for a little longer, additional scrap is to be collected and bought with

### Score
After clearing all three levels a score is calculated taking into account:

The time it took you to escape
The amount of scrap metal you extracted
Register your score in the leaderboard and take on a battle with the whole internet.

## Credit
I am not that good of an artist (nor am I a sound designer), meaning some of the assets used were not created by me, although I did my best.

Laboratory 2d game tileset and side view door and key by Robert Brooks: Used to construct rooms and design additional sprites and key sprites
Input Prompts by Kenny:  Used for the 'E' tooltip
Also I want to be clear about something: 
I made use of AI generated art in this game.  No sprite is directly made from an AI (besides the scrap metal one, which is collaged together from an AI generation), but I used Ai as a way to create prototypes of sprites. I used it as a way to obtain silhouette and structure of certain elements, something I could have not done on my own some times. I then modified the style to somewhat fit the other sprites in my game, by modifying and coloring images that were generated close to my intentions to ultimately fit them.
